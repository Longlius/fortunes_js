# Unix fortunes for JavaScript

A hack-y implementation of the Unix fortunes for Javascript.

## Usage:

Import `fortunes.js` into your web page and call `getRandomFortune()` to get a random fortune from the list. Inject this into whatever DOM element you want.

## TODO:
Write scripts to convert files in the fortune(6) format into JavaScript string arrays. Create a build process to automate this and bundle the JS for easier deployment. Add support for getting different classes of fortunes. Maybe implement all the flags fortune(1) has?
